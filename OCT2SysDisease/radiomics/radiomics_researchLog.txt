Radiomics = Genomics
Radiomic data has the potential to uncover disease characteristics that fail to be appreciated by the naked eye.
Logistic Regression + L1/L2 regulirization = elasticNet

1  thickness images: 9x31x25
2  texture image with sigmented mask: 31xSegHx512
3  some features:
   GLCM: is a direction x n x n matrix, where n is the number of gray levels,
   Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM):  a matrix of direction x n x Length, where n is the number of gray leveles.
   Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM):   a matrix of n x maxZoneSize, where n is the number of gray levels.
   Gray Level Dependece Matrix (GLDM):    a matrix of n x maxDepenceNum, where n is the number of gray levels.
   Neighboring Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM):  a matrix of nx4, where n is the number of gray levels.


4  radiomics feature extracion at whole dataset;
5  use elasticNet for feature selection at whole dataset;
6  use 10-fold crossing-validation to measure performance;


Notes:
GLCM: The function creates a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) by calculating how often a pixel with the intensity (gray-level) value i occurs in a specific spatial relationship to a pixel with the value j.
