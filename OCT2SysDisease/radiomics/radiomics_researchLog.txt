Radiomics = Genomics
Radiomic data has the potential to uncover disease characteristics that fail to be appreciated by the naked eye.
Logistic Regression + L1/L2 regulirization = elasticNet

1  thickness images: 9x31x25
2  texture image with sigmented mask: 31xSegHx512
1  radiomics feature extracion at whole dataset;
2  use elasticNet for feature selection at whole dataset;
3  use 10-fold crossing-validation to measure performance;
