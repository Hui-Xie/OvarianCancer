A new idea for ovarian cancer prediction: 3D volume image as input, all weakly segmented labels and clinical data as ground truth.
It is not the case that clinical data as input to deduce the survival label, which is like to use clinical data to directly predict result.
It limits the use of clinical data as direct factors for final survival result prediction.  If this method could succeed, it should have succeed earlier.
For this unknown pattern to predict survival, we hope to use clinical data to guide network to generate some unknown features,
and then use these unknown features to predict our final label.
In other words, these clinical data is to explore features, rather than just a direct contributing factor to the final prediction.

Benefits of this new idea:
A. It adds the number of ground truth, which effectively alleviates overfitting on the small data set with a binary label.
B. In a single survival target ground truth context, it is easy to overfit.
   This new idea is like to add disturbations or noises to the easy-overfitting single-survival-ground-truth network to get a better generalization.


Some design considerations:
A. How to weight different kinds of features pointing different label categories, or different kinds of loss:
   Each kind of loss needs a super parameter weight. We can initialize them all as 1.0.
   a1. if a loss decreases too quick, reduce its weight.
   a2. design a mechanism to measure loss's normalized acceleration,e.g. (2(a2-a1)/(a1+a2))
       and reduce the weight of bigger acceleration, increase the weight of small acceleration.
   a3. Hope this dynamic weight adjustment to find real valuable and balanced features.
   a4. remember to save these dynamic weight.

B. How to design an organic network to effective to support different kinds of ground truth.

Basic methods we tried in 2019 for ovarian cancer prediction project:
1  segment weak annotated slices.
2  segment fully expand marked 3D slices, with my manually expand ground truth.
3  use latent vector of U-Net to predict survival: FC classifier, Vote classifier.
4  use logistic regression to cherry-pick features in the latent vector, and then predict survival.
5  use latent vector from high-dice segmentation result to predict survival.
6  use 2D MobileNetV3 with slice as channel to directly predict survival.
7  use 3D Conv net directly to predict survival.

Some lessons in the experiments before:
1  Do not reduce/select patient samples, as the whole sample is already too small(less than 200).
2  try to fully use all samples, and all clinical data information to help train network.
3  AI basing on huge training samples may be smarter than human,
   but don't expect a deep learning on a small number of training samples is smarter than human.
3  Do not expect too high accuracy expectation as this project is more possible a sky-project than OCT to HBP project.
   As this project perfectly fits characteristic of a sky project:
   A.  ground truth come from another mechanism instead of input images.
   B.  domain experts can not deduce the ground truth using logic and domain knowledge from the input images.
4  A reasonable goal is that predict test accuracy >70%, and then we need to consider to write a paper.
5  I do not want to waste another 5 months like the OCT to HBP project, without a paper out.







====================================
cell type: 12 types.
High grade serous,
Micropapillary low grade serous,
low grade serous,
High grade adenocarcinoma,
Adenocarcinoma of mullerian origin,
serous borderline,
borderline serous with micro invasion
papillary serous of the endometrium,
no cancer
granulosa cell tumor
mixed high grade serous and endometrioid

TNM system:
T: X, 0, 1,2,3,
N: X, 0, 1,2,3
M: X, 0, 1,

stage:
Stage 0:
	Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue. Also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS. CIS is not cancer, but it may become cancer.
Stage I, Stage II, and Stage III:
	Cancer is present. The higher the number, the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues.
Stage IV:
	The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.

0, I, II, III, IV, with A,B,C as substage.

optimal result:
A  after surgery, tumor<2cm;
B  survive for 90 days after surgery;
C  chemical therapy reponse good;

Pofessor Wu directed:
1  For each patient, consider its specific cancer range to choose proper slice range;
2  and then downsample and upsampel to get uniform image size;
3  may consider 3D convolution to do this job;
4  when the new server arrive, ralaunch this job;
