Minutes of mouse OCT segmentation:
1  Ying Hsu is a postdoc researching on gene therapy of mouse's degenerative diseases.
   This project uses mouse's OCT segmentation result to measure gene therapy effect, and inference human's treatment.
2  It focuses on cones/rods of retina, and at its slide, instead of fovea part.
3  Ying offers initial 30-40 volume mouse images, we can do initial segmentation, and Ying can correct them.
4  Based on corrected data, we can further trian network to get final segmentation result.
