Prepare IVUS data for sufraceSubnet_Q experiment:
This IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound) data set is a public dataset B from IVUS challenge 2011 \cite{IVUSChallenge2011}.
Its goal is to segment the inner wall(lumen) and outer wall(media) of vessels in intra-vascular ultrasound images obtained by 20 MHz IVUS scanner from 10 patients.
Training set includes 109 images, in which we randomly choose 9 images for validation in training process;
and test data includes 326 images. The raw IVUS image has pixel size of 384*384 with in-frame resolution of 0.026*0.026mm.
We convert them into polar coordinate images of size 192*360 pixels, around the center point of the raw image, where 192 is maximum radial coordinate,
and 360 is the maximum angular coordinate in degree.
We feed these polar images into our deep learning network, and directly evaluate our prediction result using a Matlab script published in IVUS Chanellenge \cite{IVUSChallenge2011}.
The Matlab scrip evaluates the average Jaccard similarity measurement(Jacc), Dice, Hausdorff Distance(HD), and Percentage of Area Difference (PAD) referred from \cite{IVUSChallenge2011}.
In our experiment, we used dynamic $\vec{\sigma}$ from $\vec{\mu}/\vec{\sigma}$ computation module to generate Gaussian ground truth,
and used gaussian noise, pepper\&salt noise, and arbitrary degree rotation on raw image for data augmentation.
Test used TTA(Test-Time Augmentation) in \SI{20}{\degree} step rotation, and then average 18 rotated back result as our final result.
FBBR-2 and our method use same data augmentationa and TTA.

IVUS data set(100%):
training: 100 images.
validaiton: 9 images.
test:     326 images.

IVUS data set(10%):

   A  output format, and save
   B  measurement.
   C  data augmentation in training and validation.
   D  TTA.

5  IVUS test script:
   A  output format, and save
   B  measurement.
   C  no data augmentation.
